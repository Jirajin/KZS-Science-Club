          <p class="leading-relaxed mb-8">Artificial intelligence (AI) is the name given to technologies that try to replicate the way the human mind works. They are used in a wide range of ways, from playing games and translating speech to driving cars and helping doctors diagnose diseases.   The field of AI is advancing rapidly, with computers performing tasks that only a few years ago were considered the province of humans. Artificial intelligence is the latest technology craze, but it has the potential to change the way we live, work, and think. The phrase conjures up images of robots, self-driving cars, and computer games that challenge our skills and intelligence. But over the last few decades, AI has evolved from a niche technology used by only the most specialized companies to a mainstream product that can be found in almost every industry. Today, AI is used to power a wide range of products and services, from the chatbots that provide customer service on Facebook Messenger, to the image recognition software that can tell a photo of a person from a picture of a tree, to the algorithms that provide recommendations on Netflix, to the programs that can translate text and speech.</p>

          <p class="leading-relaxed mb-8">"Learning is a slow process." - This is one of the most valuable pieces of advice I've got! Nothing is easy to learn. Long hours of dedication, keeping away from your dear ones, and pushing your limits further are at the heart of learning. So, why should we learn? What makes parents so desperate to educate their children? </p>
          <p class="leading-relaxed mb-8">It all starts with survival. Do you know the difference between you and your favorite pet cat? The cat learns to hunt, but you learn to think. Thinking has made us what we are. If the previous ones could not practice and master the noble art of thinking, we would remain one of the weakest of all animals on the planet. The fact that we were too weak was crucial for our dominance. It has inspired us to think of an alternative way to survive here. It is also the reason why some people become mad to learn. They even forget their whereabouts for the sake of their thirst for knowledge! </p>
          <p class="leading-relaxed mb-8">However, you do not like to think that much. Am I right? Have you ever wondered why it is so? It is because hardness is at the very core of thinking. It is like a child. The more you love it, the more it loves you. And if you do not value it, it will not assist you by any means. The process of thinking takes effort. So our brain has its techniques to overcome this problem. It has two systems - one that thinks and solves problems and another that gives an automatic, quick response to the situation. So, when you try to understand a poem, it takes time. It is a painful process. But once you've understood it completely, it will become an automatic and easy task! But most of us give up in the first place. Hence, learning feels uncomfortable.</p>
          <p class="leading-relaxed mb-8">So what can we do? It's easy! Never put away some topics just because they are difficult. Doing that will probably make them ferocious and make the next steps even more difficult. And since learning is a slow process, you must believe in yourself. You must be patient and dedicated! You need to practice a LOT and solve problems to push your limits as if you were fighting for your life in a war. If you follow this advice, the art of learning will be more beautiful than anything you can imagine.</p>
