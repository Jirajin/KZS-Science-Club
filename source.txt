                  <p class="leading-relaxed mb-5">Artificial intelligence (AI) is the name given to technologies that try to replicate the way the human mind works. They are used in a wide range of ways, from playing games and translating speech to driving cars and helping doctors diagnose diseases.   The field of AI is advancing rapidly, with computers performing tasks that only a few years ago were considered the province of humans. Artificial intelligence is the latest technology craze, but it has the potential to change the way we live, work, and think. The phrase conjures up images of robots, self-driving cars, and computer games that challenge our skills and intelligence. But over the last few decades, AI has evolved from a niche technology used by only the most specialized companies to a mainstream product that can be found in almost every industry. Today, AI is used to power a wide range of products and services, from the chatbots that provide customer service on Facebook Messenger, to the image recognition software that can tell a photo of a person from a picture of a tree, to the algorithms that provide recommendations on Netflix, to the programs that can translate text and speech.</p>
